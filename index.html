   <li>The meaning of "Sabr"</li>


<ul 1>"Sabr" is an arabic word for "endurance", "perseverance","persistence". I belive
    that it is important for everyone to have these qualitys because we all go through hardships.
    For Example, you might of lost something that is important to you such as a love one. Or wealth
    whatever it may be. Us as humans have to go through life with these hardships thats why its important to have
    "Sabr" and have to patience so we can move on in life.
